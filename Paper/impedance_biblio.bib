  abstract = "Most synaptic inputs are made onto the dendritic tree. Recent
              work has shown that dendrites play an active role in transforming
              synaptic input into neuronal output and in defining the
              relationships between active synapses. In this review, we discuss
              how these dendritic properties influence the rules governing the
              induction of synaptic plasticity. We argue that the location of
              synapses in the dendritic tree, and the type of dendritic
              excitability associated with each synapse, play decisive roles in
              determining the plastic properties of that synapse. Furthermore,
              since the electrical properties of the dendritic tree are not
              static, but can be altered by neuromodulators and by synaptic
              activity itself, we discuss how learning rules may be dynamically
              shaped by tuning dendritic function. We conclude by describing
              how this reciprocal relationship between plasticity of dendritic
              excitability and synaptic plasticity has changed our view of
              information processing and memory storage in neuronal networks.",

  abstract = "Layer V pyramidal neurons are anatomically and physiologically
              heterogeneous and project to multiple intracortical and
              subcortical targets. However, because most physiological studies
              of layer V pyramidal neurons have been carried out on
              unidentified cells, we know little about how anatomical and
              physiological properties relate to subcortical projection site.
              Here we combine neuroanatomical tract tracing with whole cell
              recordings in mouse somatosensory cortex to test whether neurons
              with the same projection target form discrete subpopulations and
              whether they have stereotyped physiological properties. Our
              findings indicate that corticothalamic and -trigeminal neurons
              are two largely nonoverlapping subpopulations, whereas callosal
              and corticostriatal neurons overlap extensively. The morphology
              as well as the intrinsic membrane and firing properties of
              corticothalamic and corticotrigeminal neurons differ from those
              of callosal and corticostriatal neurons. In addition, we find
              that each class of projection neuron exhibits a unique compliment
              of hyperpolarizing and depolarizing afterpotentials that further
              suggests that cortical neurons with different subcortical targets

              basal dendrites",
  author   = "Acker, Corey D and Antic, Srdjan D",
  abstract = "Basal dendrites of prefrontal cortical neurons receive strong
              synaptic drive from recurrent excitatory synaptic inputs.
              Synaptic integration within basal dendrites is therefore likely
              to play an important role in cortical information processing.
              Both synaptic integration and synaptic plasticity depend
              crucially on dendritic membrane excitability and the
              backpropagation of action potentials. We carried out multisite
              voltage-sensitive dye imaging of membrane potential transients
              from thin basal branches of prefrontal cortical pyramidal neurons
              before and after application of channel blockers. We found that
              backpropagating action potentials (bAPs) are predominantly
              controlled by voltage-gated sodium and A-type potassium channels.
              In contrast, pharmacologically blocking the delayed rectifier
              potassium, voltage-gated calcium, or I(h) conductance had little
              effect on dendritic AP propagation. Optically recorded bAP
              waveforms were quantified and multicompartmental modeling was
              used to link the observed behavior with the underlying
              biophysical properties. The best-fit model included a nonuniform
              sodium channel distribution with decreasing conductance with
              distance from the soma, together with a nonuniform (increasing)
              A-type potassium conductance. AP amplitudes decline with distance
              in this model, but to a lesser extent than previously thought. We
              used this model to explore the mechanisms underlying two sets of
              published data involving high-frequency trains of APs and the
              local generation of sodium spikelets. We also explored the
              conditions under which I(A) down-regulation would produce branch
              strength potentiation in the proposed model. Finally, we discuss
              the hypothesis that a fraction of basal branches may have
              different membrane properties compared with sister branches in
              the same dendritic tree.",

  title    = "Passive normalization of synaptic integration influenced by

  author   = "Jaffe, D B and Carnevale, N T",
  abstract = "We examined how biophysical properties and neuronal morphology
              affect the propagation of individual postsynaptic potentials
              (PSPs) from synaptic inputs to the soma. This analysis is based
              on evidence that individual synaptic activations do not reduce
              local driving force significantly in most central neurons, so
              each synapse acts approximately as a current source. Therefore
              the spread of PSPs throughout a dendritic tree can be described
              in terms of transfer impedance (Z(c)), which reflects how a
              current applied at one location affects membrane potential at
              other locations. We addressed this topic through four lines of
              study and uncovered new implications of neuronal morphology for
              synaptic integration. First, Z(c) was considered in terms of
              two-port theory and contrasted with dendrosomatic voltage
              transfer. Second, equivalent cylinder models were used to compare
              the spatial profiles of Z(c) and dendrosomatic voltage transfer.
              These simulations showed that Z(c) is less affected by dendritic
              location than voltage transfer is. Third, compartmental models
              based on morphological reconstructions of five different neuron
              types were used to calculate Z(c), input impedance (Z(N)), and
              voltage transfer throughout the dendritic tree. For all neurons,
              there was no significant variation of Z(c) with location within
              higher-order dendrites. Furthermore, Z(c) was relatively
              independent of synaptic location throughout the entire cell in
              three of the five neuron types (CA3 interneurons, CA3 pyramidal
              neurons, and dentate granule cells). This was quite unlike Z(N),
              which increased with distance from the soma and was responsible
              for a parallel decrease of voltage transfer. Fourth, simulations
              of fast excitatory PSPs (EPSPs) were consistent with the analysis
              of Z(c); peak EPSP amplitude varied <20\% in the same three
              neuron types, a phenomenon that we call ``passive synaptic
              normalization'' to underscore the fact that it does not require
              active currents. We conclude that the presence of a long primary
              dendrite, as in CA1 or neocortical pyramidal cells, favors
              substantial location-dependent variability of somatic PSP
              amplitude. In neurons that lack long primary dendrites, however,
              PSP amplitude at the soma will be much less dependent on synaptic
              location.",

  abstract = "Strings on a violin are tuned to generate distinct sound
              frequencies in a manner that is firmly dependent on finger
              location along the fingerboard. Sound frequencies emerging from
              different violins could be very different based on their
              architecture, the nature of strings and their tuning.
              Analogously, active neuronal dendrites, dendrites endowed with
              active channel conductances, are tuned to distinct input
              frequencies in a manner that is dependent on the dendritic
              location of the synaptic inputs. Further, disparate channel
              expression profiles and differences in morphological
              characteristics could result in dendrites on different neurons of
              the same subtype tuned to distinct frequency ranges. Alternately,
              similar location-dependence along dendritic structures could be
              achieved through disparate combinations of channel profiles and
              morphological characteristics, leading to degeneracy in active
              dendritic spectral tuning. Akin to strings on a violin being
              tuned to different frequencies than those on a viola or a cello,
              different neuronal subtypes exhibit distinct channel profiles and
              disparate morphological characteristics endowing each neuronal

              Finally, similar to the tunability of musical instruments to
              elicit distinct location-dependent sounds, neuronal frequency
              selectivity and its location-dependence are tunable through

  abstract = "1. The complex impedances and impedance magnitude functions were
              obtained from neurons in in vitro slices of trigeminal root
              ganglia using frequency-domain analyses of intracellularly
              recorded voltage responses to specified oscillatory input
              currents. A neuronal model derived from linearized
              Hodgkin-Huxley-like equations was used to fit the complex
              impedance data. This procedure yielded estimates for membrane
              electrical properties. 2. Membrane resonance was observed in the
              impedance magnitude functions of all investigated neurons at
              their initial resting membrane potentials and was similar to that
              reported previously for trigeminal root ganglion neurons in vivo.
              Tetrodotoxin (10(-6) M), a Na+-channel blocker, applied in the
              bathing medium for 20 min produced only minor changes, if any, in
              the resonance, although gross impairment of Na+-spike
              electrogenesis was apparent in most of the neurons. Brief
              applications (1-5 min) of a K+-channel blocker,
              tetraethylammonium (TEA; 10(-2) M), increased the impedance
              magnitude and abolished, in a reversible manner, the resonant
              behavior. In all cases, the resonant frequency was decreased by
              TEA administration prior to total blockade of resonance. 3. The
              TEA-induced blockade of resonance was associated with decreases
              in the estimates of the membrane conductances, without
              significant alterations of input capacitance. A particularly
              large decrease was observed in Gr, the time-invariant resting
              conductance that includes a lumped leak conductance component.
              The voltage- and time-dependent conductance, GL, and associated
              relaxation time constant, tau u, also declined progressively
              during administration of TEA. 4. Systematic variations in the
              membrane potentials of trigeminal root ganglion neurons were
              produced by intracellular injections of long-lasting step
              currents with superposition of the oscillatory current stimuli,
              in order to assess the effects of TEA on the relationship of the
              electrical properties to the membrane potential. Applications of
              TEA led to a depolarizing shift in the dependence of the membrane
              property estimates, suggesting voltage-dependence of the effects
              of TEA on presumed K+ channels in the membrane. 5. These data
              suggest a primary involvement of K+ conductance in the genesis of
              membrane resonance. This electrical behavior or its ionic
              mechanism is a major modulator of the subthreshold electrical

              Small groups of cells were labeled with biotinylated dextran
              amine (BDA), and their axonal arborizations were individually
              reconstructed from horizontal sections counterstained for
              cytochrome oxidase. Results show that the vast majority (
              approximately 95\%) of layer 5 axons that innervate the
              somatosensory thalamus are collaterals of corticofugal fibers
              that project to the brainstem. The anterior pretectal nucleus,
              the deep layers of the superior colliculus, and the pontine
              nuclei are among the structures most often coinnervated. In the
              thalamus, layer 5 axons terminate exclusively in the dorsal part
              of the posterior group (Po), where they form clusters of large
              terminations. Because dorsal Po projects to multiple cortical
              areas, we sought to determine whether all recipient areas return
              a layer 5 projection to this part of the thalamus. Additional
              experiments using fluoro-gold and BDA injections provided
              evidence that the primary somatosensory area is the sole source
              of layer 5 projections to dorsal Po but that this thalamic region
              receives convergent layer 6 projections from the primary and
              second somatosensory areas and from the motor and insular
              cortices. These results show that layer 5 projections do not
              overlap in associative thalamic nuclei, thus defining
              area-related subdivisions. Furthermore, the coinnervation of
              brainstem nuclei by layer 5 CT axons suggests that this pathway
              conveys to the thalamus a copy of the cortical output aimed at

              tree to all six layers of the mammalian neocortex and serves as a
              major building block for the cortical column. L5b pyramidal cells
              have been the subject of extensive experimental and modeling
              studies, yet conductance-based models of these cells that
              faithfully reproduce both their perisomatic Na(+)-spiking
              behavior as well as key dendritic active properties, including
              Ca(2+) spikes and back-propagating action potentials, are still
              lacking. Based on a large body of experimental recordings from
              both the soma and dendrites of L5b pyramidal cells in adult rats,
              we characterized key features of the somatic and dendritic firing
              and quantified their statistics. We used these features to
              constrain the density of a set of ion channels over the soma and
              dendritic surface via multi-objective optimization with an
              evolutionary algorithm, thus generating a set of detailed
              conductance-based models that faithfully replicate the
              back-propagating action potential activated Ca(2+) spike firing
              and the perisomatic firing response to current steps, as well as
              the experimental variability of the properties. Furthermore, we
              show a useful way to analyze model parameters with our sets of
              models, which enabled us to identify some of the mechanisms
              responsible for the dynamic properties of L5b pyramidal cells as
              well as mechanisms that are sensitive to morphological changes.
              This automated framework can be used to develop a database of
              faithful models for other neuron types. The models we present
              provide several experimentally-testable predictions and can serve
              as a powerful tool for theoretical investigations of the

              a subset of synapses that are, presumably, functionally relevant

              is that a neuron has one resonant frequency and thus can pass
              through one rate. Here we demonstrate through mathematical
              analyses and numerical simulations that dendritic resonance is
              inevitably a spatially distributed property; and therefore the

              roles these dendritic ion channels play in neuronal information
              processing, and there is no consensus on why neuronal dendrites
              should express diverse ion channels with different expression
              profiles. In this review, we present a case for viewing dendritic
              information processing through the lens of the sensory map
              literature, where functional gradients within neurons are
              considered as maps on the neuronal topograph. Under such a
              framework, drawing analogies from the sensory map literature, we
              postulate that the formation of intraneuronal functional maps is
              driven by the twin objectives of efficiently encoding inputs that
              impinge along different dendritic locations and of retaining
              homeostasis in the face of changes that are required in the
              coding process. In arriving at this postulate, we relate
              intraneuronal map physiology to the vast literature on sensory
              maps and argue that such a metaphorical association provides a
              fresh conceptual framework for analyzing and understanding
              single-neuron information encoding. We also describe instances
              where the metaphor presents specific directions for research on
              intraneuronal maps, derived from analogous pursuits in the

              thesis for why neurons should express and alter ion channels in
              their dendrites and provides a framework under which active

              contribute to theta-rhythm generation in the entorhinal cortex
              and to generation of grid cell firing patterns. However, it is
              unclear whether single neurons have a fixed unique oscillation
              frequency or whether their frequency varies depending on the mean
              membrane potential in a cell. We therefore examined the frequency
              of SMPOs at different membrane potentials in layer II
              stellate-like cells of the rat medial entorhinal cortex in vitro.
              Using whole-cell patch recordings, we found that the fluctuations
              in membrane potential show a broad band of low power frequencies
              near resting potential that transition to more narrowband
              oscillation frequencies with depolarization. The transition from
              broadband to narrowband frequencies depends on the location of
              the neuron along the dorsoventral axis in the entorhinal cortex,
              with dorsal neurons transitioning to higher-frequency

              guinea pigs have been determined using frequency-domain analyses
              of small-amplitude perturbations of membrane voltage. The complex
              impedance functions of trigeminal ganglion neurons were computed
              from the ratios of the fast Fourier transforms of the
              intracellularly recorded voltage response from the neuron and of
              the input current, which had a defined oscillatory waveform. The
              impedance magnitude functions and corresponding impedance locus
              diagrams were fitted with various membrane models such that the
              passive and active properties were quantified. The complex
              impedances of less than one-quarter of the 105 neurons which were
              investigated extensively could be described by the complex
              impedance function for a simple RC-electrical circuit. In such
              neurons, the voltage responses to constant-current pulses, using
              conventional bridge-balance techniques, could be fitted with
              single exponential curves, also suggesting passive membrane
              behavior. A nonlinear least-squares fit of the complex impedance
              function for the simple model to the experimentally observed
              complex impedance yielded estimates of the resistance of the

              input resistance (range, 0.8 to 30 M omega) of the neurons. The
              majority of trigeminal ganglion neurons were characterized by a
              resonance in the 50- to 250-Hz bandwidth of their impedance
              magnitude functions. Such neurons when injected with ``large''
              hyperpolarizing current pulses using bridge-balance techniques
              showed membrane voltage responses that ``sagged'' (time-dependent
              rectification). Also, repetitive firing commonly occurred with
              depolarizing current pulses; this characteristic of neurons with
              resonance in their impedance magnitude functions was not observed
              in neurons with ``purely'' passive membrane behavior. A nonlinear

              based on a membrane model to the impedance locus diagram of a

              input current, and the relaxation time constant for this
              conductance. The ranges of the estimates for input capacitance
              and input resistance were comparable to the ranges of

              spike output. However, the response properties of dendrites to
              time-varying inputs are largely unknown. Here, I determine the
              transfer impedance of the apical dendrite in layer V pyramidal
              cells by dual whole cell patch-clamp recordings in slices of rat
              somatosensory cortex. Sinusoidal current waveforms of linearly
              changing frequencies (0.1-25 Hz) were alternately injected into
              the soma or apical dendrite and the resulting voltage
              oscillations recorded by the second electrode. Dendrosomatic and
              somatodendritic transfer impedances were calculated by Fourier
              analysis. At near physiological temperatures (T approximately 35
              degrees C), the transfer impedance had a maximal magnitude at low
              frequencies (f(res) approximately 6 Hz). In addition, voltage led
              current up to approximately 3 Hz, followed by a current lead over
              voltage at higher frequencies. Thus the transfer impedance of the
              apical dendrite is characterized by a low-frequency resonance.
              The frequency of the resonance was voltage dependent, and its
              strength increased with dendritic distance. The resonance was
              completely abolished by the I(h) channel blocker ZD 7288.
              Dendrosomatic and somatodendritic transfer properties of the
              apical dendrite were independent of direction or amplitude of the
              input current, and the responses of individual versus distributed
              inputs were additive, thus implying linearity. For just threshold
              current injections, action potentials were generated
              preferentially at the resonating frequency. I conclude that due
              to the interplay of a sag current (I(h)) with the membrane
              capacitance, layer V pyramids can act as linear band-pass filters

              atrophy on nine such functional maps, related to input resistance
              and local/transfer impedance properties, using conductance-based
              models of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. We introduced
              progressive dendritic atrophy in a CA1 pyramidal neuron
              reconstruction through a pruning algorithm, measured all
              functional maps in each pruned reconstruction, and arrived at
              functional forms for the dependence of underlying measurements on
              dendritic length. We found that, across frequencies, atrophied
              neurons responded with higher efficiency to incoming inputs, and
              the transfer of signals across the dendritic tree was more
              effective in an atrophied reconstruction. Importantly, despite

              gradients in input resistance, local/transfer resonance
              frequencies and impedance profiles were significantly constricted

  abstract = "KEY POINTS: Quantitative metrics for the temporal window of
              integration/coincidence detection, based on the spike-triggered
              average, were employed to assess the emergence and dependence of
              gamma-range coincidence detection in hippocampal pyramidal
              neurons on various ion channel combinations. The presence of
              hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN)
              channels decreased the coincidence detection window (CDW) of the
              neuronal compartment to the gamma frequency range. Interaction of
              HCN channels with T-type calcium channels and persistent sodium
              channels further reduced the CDW, whereas interaction with A-type
              potassium channels broadened the CDW. When multiple channel
              gradients were co-expressed, the high density of resonating
              conductances in the distal dendrites led to a slow gamma CDW in
              the proximal dendrites and a fast-gamma CDW in the distal
              dendrites. The presence of resonating and spike-generating
              conductances serve as a mechanism underlying the emergence of
              stratified gamma-range coincidence detection in the dendrites of
              CA1 pyramidal neurons, enabling them to perform behaviour- and
              state-dependent gamma frequency multiplexing. ABSTRACT:
              Hippocampal pyramidal neurons exhibit gamma-phase preference in
              their spikes, selectively route inputs through gamma frequency
              multiplexing and are considered part of gamma-bound cell
              assemblies. How do these neurons exhibit gamma-frequency
              coincidence detection capabilities, a feature that is essential
              for the expression of these physiological observations, despite
              their slow membrane time constant? In this conductance-based
              modelling study, we developed quantitative metrics for the
              temporal window of integration/coincidence detection based on the
              spike-triggered average (STA) of the neuronal compartment. We
              employed these metrics in conjunction with quantitative measures
              for spike initiation dynamics to assess the emergence and
              dependence of coincidence detection and STA spectral selectivity
              on various ion channel combinations. We found that the presence
              of resonating conductances (hyperpolarization-activated cyclic
              nucleotide-gated or T-type calcium), either independently or
              synergistically when expressed together, led to the emergence of
              spectral selectivity in the spike initiation dynamics and a
              significant reduction in the coincidence detection window (CDW).
              The presence of A-type potassium channels, along with resonating
              conductances, reduced the STA characteristic frequency and
              broadened the CDW, but persistent sodium channels sharpened the
              CDW by strengthening the spectral selectivity in the STA.
              Finally, in a morphologically precise model endowed with
              experimentally constrained channel gradients, we found that
              somatodendritic compartments expressed functional maps of strong
              theta-frequency selectivity in spike initiation dynamics and
              gamma-range CDW. Our results reveal the heavy expression of

              using weak electric fields. Given the pathological changes in
              brain network oscillations in neurological and psychiatric
              illnesses, using alternating electric field waveforms that engage
              rhythmic activity has been proposed as a targeted, network-level
              treatment approach. Previous studies have investigated the
              effects of electric fields at the neuronal level. However, the
              biophysical basis of the cellular response to electric fields has
              remained limited. Here, we characterized the frequency-dependent
              response of different compartments in a layer V pyramidal neuron
              to exogenous electric fields to dissect the relative
              contributions of voltage-gated ion channels and neuronal
              morphology. Hyperpolarization-activated cation current (Ih) in
              the distal dendrites was the primary ionic mechanism shaping the
              model's response to electric field stimulation and caused
              subthreshold resonance in the tuft at 20 $\pm$ 4 Hz. In contrast,
              subthreshold Ih-mediated resonance in response to local
              sinusoidal current injection was present in all model
              compartments at 11 $\pm$ 2 Hz. The frequencies of both resonance
              responses were modulated by Ih conductance density. We found that
              the difference in resonance frequency between the two stimulation
              types can be explained by the fact that exogenous electric fields
              simultaneously polarize the membrane potentials at the distal
              ends of the neuron (relative to field direction) in opposite
              directions. Our results highlight the role of Ih in shaping the
              cellular response to electric field stimulation and suggest that
              the common model of tCS as a weak somatic current injection fails
              to capture the cellular effects of electric field stimulation.

              unknown. Here we use variance-mean analysis to study the
              properties of single Ih channels in the apical dendrites of
              cortical layer 5 pyramidal neurons in vitro. In these neurons, we
              find that Ih channels have an average unitary conductance of 680
              +/- 30 fS (n = 18). Spectral analysis of simulated and native Ih
              channels showed that there is little or no channel flicker below
              5 kHz. In contrast to the uniformly distributed single-channel
              conductance, Ih channel number increases exponentially with
              distance, reaching densities as high as approximately 550
              channels/microm2 at distal dendritic sites. These high channel
              densities generate significant membrane voltage noise. By
              incorporating a stochastic model of Ih single-channel gating into

              that this channel noise is higher in distal dendritic

              not only upon which subsets of postsynaptic neurons receive
              input, but also, and equally importantly, upon what cellular
              subcompartments the projections target. Neocortical pyramidal
              neurons receive input onto their apical dendrites. However,
              physiological characterization of these inputs thus far has been
              exclusively somatocentric, leaving how the dendrites respond to
              spatial and temporal patterns of input unexplored. Here we used a
              combination of optogenetics with multisite electrode recordings
              to simultaneously measure dendritic and somatic responses to
              afferent fiber activation in two different populations of layer 5
              (L5) pyramidal neurons in the rat medial prefrontal cortex

              (PT) dendrites, whereas monosynaptic hippocampal input primarily
              targeted IT, but not PT, dendrites. To understand the role of

              used dynamic clamp to simulate synaptic currents in the

              were particularly responsive to dendritic inputs within the gamma

              coincidence detectors by responding to spatially distributed

              and accelerate in firing frequency when depolarized, whereas COM
              neurons have high temporal summation and display spike frequency
              accommodation. In response to dynamic stimuli, COM neurons act as
              low-pass filters, whereas CPn neurons act as bandpass filters,
              resonating in the theta frequency range (3-6 Hz). The disparate

              quantitative framework to analyze the extent of influence of a
              spatially localized VGIC conductance on different physiological
              properties along the entire stretch of a neuron. Employing this
              framework, we show that the extent of influence of a VGIC
              conductance is largely independent of the conductance magnitude
              but is heavily dependent on the specific physiological property
              and background conductances. Morphologically, our analyses
              demonstrate that the influences of different VGIC conductances
              located on an oblique dendrite are confined within that oblique
              dendrite, thus providing further credence to the postulate that
              dendritic branches act as independent computational units.
              Furthermore, distinguishing between active and passive
              propagation of signals within a neuron, we demonstrate that the
              influence of a VGIC conductance is spatially confined only when
              propagation is active. Finally, we reconstruct functional
              gradients from VGIC conductance gradients using influence fields
              and demonstrate that the cumulative contribution of VGIC
              conductances in adjacent compartments plays a critical role in
              determining physiological properties at a given location. We
              suggest that our framework provides a quantitative basis for
              unraveling the roles of dendritic VGICs and their plasticity in
              neural coding, learning, and homeostasis.",

              measured spectral tuning before and after blocking KA channels
              using two structurally distinct pharmacological agents.
              Consistent with computational predictions, we found that blocking

              developed explicitly is that since the three currents, in
              general, have nonzero resting values and two currents, the ``Na''
              system and the ``K'' system, are controlled by voltage-dependent

              current injections at different frequencies (ZAP protocol),

              approximately 33 degrees C (increasing to approximately 7 Hz at
              approximately 38 degrees C). The theta-resonance showed a
              U-shaped voltage dependence, being strong at subthreshold,
              depolarized (approximately -60 mV) and hyperpolarized
              (approximately -80 mV) potentials, but weaker near the resting
              potential (-72 mV). Voltage clamp experiments revealed three
              non-inactivating currents operating in the subthreshold voltage
              range: (1) M-current (I(M)), which activated positive to -65 mV

              a persistent Na(+) current (I(NaP)), which activated positive to

              depolarized, but not hyperpolarized membrane potentials, whereas
              ZD7288 abolished the resonance only at hyperpolarized potentials.
              We conclude that these cells show two forms of theta-resonance:

              amplitude and, especially, phase of neuronal impedance, and their
              roles in modulating temporal dynamics of neuronal responses have
              surprisingly remained unexplored. In this study, we demonstrate
              that the h channel contributes a location-dependent and plastic
              phenomenological inductive component to the input impedance of
              CA1 pyramidal neurons. Specifically, we show that the h channels
              introduce an apparent negative delay in the local voltage
              response of these neurons with respect to the injected current
              within the theta frequency range. The frequency range and the
              extent of this lead expand with increases in h current either
              through hyperpolarization, or with increasing distance of
              dendritic location from the soma. We also demonstrate that a
              spatially widespread increase in this inductive phase component
              accompanies long-term potentiation. Finally, using impedance
              analysis, we show that both location and activity dependence of
              intrinsic phase response are attributable not to changes in a
              capacitive or a leak component, but to changes in h-channel
              properties. Our results suggest that certain voltage-gated ion
              channels can differentially regulate internal time delays within
              neurons, thus providing them with an independent control
              mechanism in temporal coding of neuronal information. Our
              analyses and results also establish impedance as a powerful
              measure of intrinsic dynamics and excitability, given that it
              quantifies temporal relationships among signals and excitability
              as functions of input frequency.",

              Here we show that pyramidal neurons in the rodent hippocampus use

              localization profiles, and associated signaling machinery.
              Despite this, neurons exhibit amazingly stereotypic,
              topographically continuous maps of several functional properties
              along their active dendritic arbor. Here, we asked whether the
              membrane composition of neurons, at the level of individual ion
              channels, is constrained by this structural requirement of
              sustaining several functional maps along the same topograph. We
              performed global sensitivity analysis on morphologically
              realistic conductance-based models of hippocampal pyramidal
              neurons that coexpressed six well-characterized functional maps
              along their trunk. We generated randomized models by varying 32
              underlying parameters and constrained these models with
              quantitative experimental measurements from the soma and
              dendrites of hippocampal pyramidal neurons. Analyzing valid
              models that satisfied experimental constraints on all six

              the segregated termination zones of thalamocortical axons of the

              microcircuits, which have begun to be investigated in
              quantitative detail. In addition to these local synaptic

              trains and synaptically evoked responses from neurons of mouse
              barrel cortex. Cells were classified as regular spiking (RS),
              intrinsically bursting (IB), or fast spiking (FS) according to
              their temporal firing patterns when injected with current. RS
              cells were further separated into two subtypes, RS1 and RS2
              cells, the latter encountered only in the infragranular layers.
              Synaptic responses were elicited by focal electrical stimuli in
              the ventrobasal nucleus of the thalamus (VB) while holding the
              cells at different membrane potentials. Postsynaptic potentials
              were classified as excitatory (EPSPs) or inhibitory (IPSPs), and
              their latencies were measured from the onset of the
              extracellularly recorded fiber volley in layer IV. EPSPs fell
              into three groups, according to latency. Those in the early
              cluster had latencies shorter than 1 msec and were coincident
              with the postsynaptic layer IV population response; they were
              considered monosynaptic. A second group, with latencies between
              1.3 and 2.5 msec, were coincident with all IPSPs and were
              classified as disynaptic. The rest had latencies longer than 5
              msec and were considered polysynaptic. The synaptic order of a
              cell was correlated with its laminar position and its
              electrophysiological class. Specifically, monosynaptic responses
              were restricted to infragranular RS cells and to FS cells, while
              disynaptic EPSPs were found in supragranular RS cells and in IB
              cells. Disynaptic IPSPs were found in both deep and superficial
              layers; in the deep layers they nearly always followed
              monosynaptic EPSPs, while in the superficial layers they were
              mostly found in isolation. We conclude that the intrinsic spiking
              characteristics of a neuron are an important determinant of its
              position in the cortical circuit and may have a substantial role
              in determining its response properties.",

              be the main route by which sensory organs communicate with
              cortex. Sensory information is believed to then propagate through
              the cortical column along the
              L4$\rightarrow$L2/3$\rightarrow$L5/6 pathway. Here, we show that
              sensory-evoked responses of L5/6 neurons in rats derive instead
              from direct TC synapses. Many L5/6 neurons exhibited
              sensory-evoked postsynaptic potentials with the same latencies as
              L4. Paired in vivo recordings from L5/6 neurons and thalamic
              neurons revealed substantial convergence of direct TC synapses
              onto diverse types of infragranular neurons, particularly in L5B.
              Pharmacological inactivation of L4 had no effect on
              sensory-evoked synaptic input to L5/6 neurons. L4 is thus not an
              obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus
              activates two separate, independent ``strata'' of cortex in
              parallel.",

  title    = "An electrical tuning mechanism in turtle cochlear hair cells",
  author   = "Crawford, A C and Fettiplace, R",
  abstract = "1. Intracellular recordings were made from single cochlear hair
              cells in the isolated half-head of the turtle. The electrical
              responses of the cells were recorded under two conditions: (a)
              when the ear was stimulated with low-intensity tones of different
              frequencies and (b) when current steps were injected through the
              intracellular electrode. The aim of the experiments was to
              evaluate the extent to which the cochlea's frequency selectivity
              could be accounted for by the electrical properties of the hair
              cells.2. At low levels of acoustic stimulation, the amplitude of
              the hair cell's receptor potential was proportional to sound
              pressure. The linear tuning curve, which is defined as the
              sensitivity of the cell as a function of frequency when the cell
              is operating in its linear range, was measured for a number of
              hair cells with characteristic frequencies from 86 Hz to 425
              Hz.3. A rectangular current passed into a hair cell elicited a
              membrane potential change consisting of a damped oscillation
              superimposed on a step. Small currents produced symmetrical
              oscillations at the beginning and end of the pulse. Larger
              currents increased the initial ringing frequency if depolarizing
              and decreased it if hyperpolarizing.4. For small currents the
              frequency of the oscillations and the quality factor (Q) of the
              electrical resonance derived from the decay of the oscillations
              were close to the characteristic frequency and Q of the hair-cell
              linear tuning curve obtained from sound presentations.5. The hair
              cell's membrane potential change to small-current pulses or
              low-intensity tone bursts could be largely described by
              representing the hair cell as a simple electrical resonator
              consisting of an inductance, resistor and capacitor.6. When step
              displacements of 29-250 nm were applied to a micropipette, placed
              just outside a hair cell in the basilar papilla, an initial
              periodic firing of impulses could be recorded from single fibres
              in the auditory nerve. Currents of up to 1 nA, injected through
              the same micropipette, failed to produce any change in the
              auditory nerve discharge. The experiment demonstrates that
              current injection does not produce gross movements of the
              electrode tip.7. The contribution of the electrical resonance to
              hair-cell tuning was assessed by dividing the linear tuning curve
              by the cell's impedance as a function of frequency. The procedure
              assumes that the electrical resonance is independent of other
              filtering stages, and on this assumption the resonance can
              account for the tip of the acoustical tuning curve.8. The
              residual filter produced by the division was broad; it exhibited
              a high-frequency roll-off with a corner frequency at 500-600 Hz,
              similar in all cells, and a low-frequency roll-off, with a corner
              frequency from 30 to 350 Hz which varied from cell to cell but
              was uncorrelated with the characteristic frequency of the cell.9.
              The phase of the receptor potential relative to the sound
              pressure at the tympanum was measured in ten cells. For low
              intensities the phase characteristic was independent of the sound
              pressure. At low frequencies the receptor potential led the sound
              by 270-360 degrees , and in the region of the characteristic
              frequency there was an abrupt phase lag of 90-180 degrees ; the
              abruptness of the phase change depended upon the Q of the
              cell.10. The calculated phase shift of the electrical resonator
              as a function of frequency was subtracted from the phase
              characteristic of the receptor potential. The subtraction removed
              the sharp phase transition around the characteristic frequency,
              and in this frequency region the residual phase after subtraction
              was approximately constant at +180 degrees . This is consistent
              with the idea that the hair cells depolarize in response to
              displacements of the basilar membrane towards the scala
              vestibuli. The high-frequency region of the residual phase
              characteristic was similar in all cells.11. It is concluded that
              each hair cell contains its own electrical resonance mechanism
              which accounts for most of the frequency selectivity of the
              receptor potential. All cells also show evidence of a broad
              band-pass filter, the high frequency portion of which may be
              produced by the action of the middle ear.",

              inaccessibility for electrical recordings. A new approach to
              patch-clamp recordings enabled us to characterize the integrative
              properties of these cells. Despite the short physical length of
              rat basal dendrites, synaptic inputs were electrotonically remote
              from the soma (>30-fold excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP)
              attenuation) and back-propagating action potentials were
              significantly attenuated. Unitary EPSPs were location dependent,
              reaching large amplitudes distally (>8 mV), yet their somatic
              contribution was relatively location independent. Basal dendrites
              support sodium and NMDA spikes, but not calcium spikes, for 75\%
              of their length. This suggests that basal dendrites, despite
              their proximity to the site of action potential initiation, do

              apical dendritic tuft of layer 5 pyramidal neurons receives
              substantial excitatory synaptic drive and actively processes
              corticocortical input during behavior. The properties of the
              voltage-activated ion channels that regulate synaptic integration
              in tuft dendrites have, however, not been thoroughly
              investigated. Here, we use electrophysiological and optical
              approaches to examine the subcellular distribution and function
              of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated
              nonselective cation (HCN) channels in rat layer 5B pyramidal
              neurons. Outside-out patch recordings demonstrated that the
              amplitude and properties of ensemble HCN channel activity were
              uniform in patches excised from distal apical dendritic trunk and
              tuft sites. Simultaneous apical dendritic tuft and trunk
              whole-cell current-clamp recordings revealed that the
              pharmacological blockade of HCN channels decreased voltage
              compartmentalization and enhanced the generation and spread of
              apical dendritic tuft and trunk regenerative activity.
              Furthermore, multisite two-photon glutamate uncaging demonstrated

              and somatic recording sites, the blockade of HCN channels

              these compartment-specific actions of HCN channels were heavily
              influenced by the local and distributed impact of the high

              fundamental to brain function and underlies perception,
              cognition, and motor output. By applying patterned, two-photon
              glutamate uncaging, we found that single dendrites of cortical
              pyramidal neurons exhibit sensitivity to the sequence of synaptic
              activation. This sensitivity is encoded by both local dendritic
              calcium signals and somatic depolarization, leading to
              sequence-selective spike output. The mechanism involves dendritic
              impedance gradients and nonlinear synaptic N-methyl-D-aspartate
              receptor activation and is generalizable to dendrites in
              different neuronal types. This enables discrimination of patterns
              delivered to a single dendrite, as well as patterns distributed
              randomly across the dendritic tree. Pyramidal cell dendrites can
              thus act as processing compartments for the detection of synaptic
              sequences, thereby implementing a fundamental cortical
              computation.",
